Description: 
        # Sion package
        
        A [LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov/) wrapper for molecular dynamics simulations of trapped ions.
        
        ## Installation
        
        This package uses pyLion package for simulation, which is therefore required to be installed, with all additional requirements. Additionally 
        the electrode package must be installed. 
        
        The folder containing all files must be installed. Then the package is installed by running <code>python setup.py install</code> in console in the 
        same directory with the setup.py file.
        
        
        ## Getting started
        
        This package with pyLion addition allows to simulate ion dynamics above surface electrode traps: polygon and point traps, as well as some 
        useful particular traps. The 'examples' folder contains some files with example usage of several functions. Additionally the functionality to 
        calculate normal modes in general case for mixed species, and some functions defining the trap geometry. 
        
        
        
        ## Features
        *   Simulate general polygon and point surface traps
        
        *   Simulate multiple ion species in the same surface trap.
        
        *   Calculate normal modes for general case of non-linear mixed species ion crystals
        
        *	Use all features of 'pyLion' package
        
        
        ## Functionality
        
        The list of functions contained in sion:
        
        *	FiveWireTrap():		Function defines a geometry of five wire surface trap
        
        *	five_wire_trap():	Simulates a simple five wire planar trap, generated by FiveWireTrap() function.
        
        *	polygon_trap(): 	Simulates an arbitrary polygon trap with rectangular electrodes

        *	ions_in_order(): 	Ion postions of a linear isospaced ion chain near minimum 
        
        *	linear_axial_modes(): 	Calculates axial normal modes of a linear ion chain of the same ions 
        
        *	linear_radial_modes(): 	Same for radial normal modes
        
        *	hessian(): 	Calcualtes hessian of a potential of an ion crystal for mixed species ions
        
        *	normal_modes(): 	Normal modes' calculation for general case for mixed species ions in arbitrary crystal shape
        
        *	square_trap(): 	  A function, conveniently simulating the array of individual square traps by squaretrap() function
        
        
        ## File structure
        
        *  `sion`: contains all the main functions for managing the simulation.
        
        *  `examples`: example simulations showing different features of `sion`.
